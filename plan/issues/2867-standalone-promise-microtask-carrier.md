# Standalone: Wasm-native Promise / microtask carrier

## Problem

Promise construction and `.then`/`.catch`/`.finally`, plus async-function await
points, leak `env::Promise_resolve`, `Promise_reject`, `Promise_then`,
`Promise_then2`, and `__make_callback` to the JS host. Under standalone there is
no host microtask queue.

### Impact (measured 2026-06-30) — ~375 standalone-only failures (non-generator)

`Promise_then2` 766, `Promise_resolve` 788, `Promise_reject` 809,
`__make_callback` 1,198 across the gap (overlapping with async-generator #2865);
~375 have Promise/async as the dominant blocker once generators are excluded
(231 fail, 144 CE). (#1326c began standalone microtask/then work — verify what
landed.)

## Root cause

No standalone microtask queue + Promise state machine. Needs:
- a native `$Promise` struct (state: pending/fulfilled/rejected, value, reaction
  list).
- a native **microtask queue** drained at top-of-job / after the main module
  body (a Wasm-side ring buffer of pending reactions).
- `await` lowering in async functions that suspends the async frame (shares the
  resumable-frame machinery with #2864 generators) and resumes from the
  microtask drain.
- `Promise.resolve/reject/all/race/allSettled/any` as native statics.

## Implementation Plan

**`architect_spec: candidate`** — overlaps the generator-frame design (#2864).
Recommend the architect design the **resumable-frame substrate once** and share
it between async functions, generators, and async generators. Check #1326c
(`1326c-microtask-queue-and-promise-then-standalone.md`) for the partial
microtask work already present before re-deriving.

Sketch:
- `$Promise` + microtask ring in the object-runtime; drain entry called after
  module main + at each await resume.
- Replace the `Promise_*`/`__make_callback` host-import emission sites (search
  `src/codegen/**` for these names) with calls into the native carrier under
  `ctx.standalone`.
- `then`/reaction scheduling enqueues a native reaction record (closure +
  capability) instead of `__make_callback`.

## Test plan

Standalone fail/CE → pass:
- `test/built-ins/Promise/**` (resolve/reject/then/finally/all/race/allSettled/any)
- `test/language/expressions/await/**`, `test/language/statements/async-function/**`

Full `merge_group` + standalone high-water. Sequence before async generators
(#2865 depends on this + #2864). Preserve the #2375 caution: Promise proto
value-read path must not collide with runtime async-capability state (the
null-deref noted in property-access.ts:736).
